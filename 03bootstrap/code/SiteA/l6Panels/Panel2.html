                            Serverless technology will take over Middleware.
                            Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model
                            in which the cloud provider acts as the server,
                            dynamically managing the allocation of machine resources.
                            Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application,
                            rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.
                            It is a form of utility computing.

                            Automation has taken over the industry in Big way.
                            Automation, which includes both mechanized robots
                            (whether humanoid or drone-shaped) and artificially intelligent
                            software programs, are predicted to eliminate 6% of the jobs in
                            the U.S. in the next five years. And it’s not just low-wage
                            employees that need to be worried. Highly skilled, knowledge-based
                            employees in some sectors, including legal and accounting, could see
                            heir jobs decimated in the next decade. Deloitte estimates that 39% of
                            jobs in the legal sector could be automated in the next 10 years.
                            Separate research has concluded that accountants have a 95% chance of
                            losing their jobs to automation in the future.
