                <p class='lead'> Serverless technology will take over Middleware.
                Serverless computing is a cloud-computing execution model
                in which the cloud provider acts as the server, 
                dynamically managing the allocation of machine resources. 
                Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, 
                rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity.
                It is a form of utility computing.

                    Java script framework has gained more traction than Java in recent times
                    It can become a firm basis for high-end single page applications (SPAs)
                    and beneficial solution to those cases, when performance is put ahead of
                    good code organization or app structure. Ember.js.
                    Back in 2015 Ember was called the best javascript framework for
                    web application, leaving behind React and AngularJS

                <h3>Automation </h3>
                <p>
                    Automation has taken over the industry in Big way.
                    Automation, which includes both mechanized robots
                    (whether humanoid or drone-shaped) and artificially intelligent
                    software programs, are predicted to eliminate 6% of the jobs in
                    the U.S. in the next five years. And itâ€™s not just low-wage
                    employees that need to be worried. Highly skilled, knowledge-based
                    employees in some sectors, including legal and accounting, could see
                    heir jobs decimated in the next decade. Deloitte estimates that 39% of
                    jobs in the legal sector could be automated in the next 10 years.
                    Separate research has concluded that accountants have a 95% chance of
                    losing their jobs to automation in the future.

                <p>
                    Block chain will be the most prefered technology for Banking Transaction
                    A blockchain,originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks,
                    which are linked using cryptography.
                    Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,
                    a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a merkle tree root hash).
                    By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data.
                    It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties
                    efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".
                    For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer
                    network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and
                    validating new blocks.
