        <h3>Automation </h3>
        <p>
            Automation has taken over the industry in Big way.
            Automation, which includes both mechanized robots
            (whether humanoid or drone-shaped) and artificially intelligent
            software programs, are predicted to eliminate 6% of the jobs in
            the U.S. in the next five years. And itâ€™s not just low-wage
            employees that need to be worried. Highly skilled, knowledge-based
            employees in some sectors, including legal and accounting, could see
            heir jobs decimated in the next decade. Deloitte estimates that 39% of
            jobs in the legal sector could be automated in the next 10 years.
            Separate research has concluded that accountants have a 95% chance of
            losing their jobs to automation in the future.
