What is a character encoding, and why should I care?
---

In communications and information processing, ```code``` is a system of rules to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium.  

The process of ```encoding``` converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage.  
```Decoding``` is the reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish.  

One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible.  
For example, semaphore (a system of visual signaling by two flags held one in each hand), where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual letters, and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent.  

Words and sentences in text are created from characters.  
characters include the Latin letter ```á``` or the Chinese ideograph ```請``` or the Devanagari character ```ह```.  
Characters that are needed for a specific purpose are grouped into a ```character set```.  
The characters are stored in the computer as one or more ```bytes```  
To refer to characters in an unambiguous way, each character is associated with a number, called a ```code point```
Each character is stored in computers using a special code
A character ```encoding``` provides a key to unlock the code. It is a set of mappings between the bytes in the computer and the characters in the character set. Without the key, the data looks like garbage.  
  
So, when text is entered into the computer using an input device (a keyboard or in some other way), the character encoding maps the characters entered to specific bytes in the computer memory, and then to display the text it reads the bytes back into characters.  


If you use anything other than the most basic English text, people may not be able to read the content you create unless you say what character encoding you used.  
Not only does lack of character encoding information spoil the readability of displayed text, but it may mean that your data cannot be found by a search engine, or reliably processed by machines in a number of other ways.
